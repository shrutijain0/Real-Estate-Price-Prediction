# Real Estate Price Prediction
This is an End to End project for Predicting the price of an House in India.

- Created a Project Thats helps you to predict the price of the house.
- I have cleaned the dataset and made it model ready and to perform prediction.
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) on the data set to understand it and make some accurate discovery and to get some insights.
- Builded Model and found the best fit and which  had better performance
- Deployed the project using StreamLit.

## ***Data Set***:
The Data set was taken through Kaggle and had all the features which can be used in this project to predict the house price.

After I have done a lot of **Data Cleaning** and **Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)** on this dataset to make it model ready.

## ***Model Building***:
For this project i have taken 4 different model ie: 
- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Lasso Regression
- ElasticNet Regression
And after comparing the score of these model, Linear Regression fits the best model to the data.so we have used linear regression model to predict the price of the houses.

## ***Model Deployment***:
To deploy this project i have used StreamLit because streamlit is very easy and user friendly api to use and streamlit give us a variety of option when it comes to wed representation .
